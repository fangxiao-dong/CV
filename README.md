# What is This
Fangxiao's portfolio summarizing my work experience and skillsets.

## Technologies Used
Front-end: HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, Font Awesome

The contact form on the "Contact" section has a backend using Google Script to create a service to POST to for processing form data and send them as email to my Gmail account with the capability for me to reply to the mail address put on the contact form. This way, I do not need to create my own server and everything can be hosted on the Github. The Google Script is hosted on a Google Spreadsheet. Why on a spreadsheet? Because Google limits how many eamils one can send daily. With a spreadsheet, I am able to eaisly add feature to insert processed form data into the spreadsheet so I do not need to worry about losing important data in the future.
